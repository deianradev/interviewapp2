## 1. Create a `components` directory with a `employee` component
You can use CLI for this
```
src
  app
    components
      employees <-this is the component
```

## 2. Create a `services` directory with a `employee` service
Again, you can use CLI

## 3. Create a routing configuration
Make the employee be the default component that loads

## 4. Implement service to fetch data and display it in the employees component
This is the service you can use 
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/deianradev/interview/employees

Here is the data it contains 
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Front-End Dev",
    "name": "Jason Smith"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Business Analyst",
    "name": "Jessica Dri"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Manager",
    "name": "Brandon Green"
  }
]
```
